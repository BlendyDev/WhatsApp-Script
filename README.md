# WhatsApp-Script
A script to automate whatsapp messages.

You'll need Selenium (https://www.selenium.dev/) (This script is made for chrome, you can download the Chrome driver here: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=85.0.4183.87/)

Unzip it and place the py script AND the chromedriver.exe on the same folder.

You also need Python 3 (https://www.python.org/)
Install Selenium by typing "pip install selenium" (Maybe you need root privileges)

Run the py script and connect to WhatsApp web by QR, enter a chat and use the script!
